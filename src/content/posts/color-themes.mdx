import ColorThemeSwitch from '@/components/ColorThemeSwitch.astro'
import Hero from '@/components/Hero.astro'
import ModeToggle from '@/components/mode/ModeToggle.astro'
import { ColorThemes } from '@/types.ts'

Nordlys not only has a dark and light mode, but also predefined themes that are ready to use, as well as the option of adding custom themes.

## Predefined Themes

Click the buttons below to (temporarily) switch the color theme for a preview! To permanently change the color theme, simply set it in the theme configuration (`theme.config.ts`).


<div class="w-full flex justify-between flex-wrap">
  {
    ColorThemes.map((theme) => (<ColorThemeSwitch theme={theme}/>))
  }
  <div class="flex flex-col items-center justify-around">
    <span class="text-5xl"><ModeToggle/></span>
    <span class="text">light / dark</span>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="w-full flex justify-center gap-8 my-24">
  <Hero frontmatter={{gradient: true, background: true}}>preview</Hero>
  <span class="iconify text-accent mt-2 tabler--brush text-8xl"></span>
</div>

## Adding a New Theme

I addition to the predefined themes, it's very simple to add a custom theme. Simply choose a primary (accent) color and a background color, and add them to `themes.css`. Make sure to use the RGB values of the colors in the same format as shown.

```css src/style/themes.css
@layer base {
  .theme-custom {
    --accent: 0, 0, 0;
    --accent-bg: 255, 255, 255;

    &[data-mode='dark'] {
      --accent: 255, 255, 255;
      --accent-bg: 0, 0, 0;
    }
  }
```
If you want use the newly defined theme, set it in the `theme.config.ts`.

```ts src/theme.config.ts
  export default defineThemeConfig({
    colorTheme: 'theme-custom'

    // ...
```

Most likely, your IDE or editor will complain with a TypeError that the theme is not a valid choice. While this is not a critical error, to fix it, you can simply add `theme-custom` as a valid option to the `ColorThemes` array in the type definition.

```ts src/types.ts
export const ColorThemes = [
  // other themes
  'theme-custom'
] as const
```

And that's it!
