# About

Nordlys is a sleek, minimal Astro blog template, ideal for a personal blog and showcasing a projects portfolio.
It is fully customizable with baked-in theming and ready-to-use components. Developed by [FjellOverflow](https://github.com/FjellOverflow) using [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Built-in Pages

The theme includes a [landing](/) page, [blog](/posts), [projects](/projects) section, [about](/about) page and a [404](/some-url-that-does-not-exist) page. Adding new content is straightforward - simply create a new `.md` file in the `src/pages`, `src/content/posts` or `src/content/projects` directories and start writing! Take a look at the provided examples to see how to tweak and configure the pages correctly.
